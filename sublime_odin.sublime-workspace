required libraries are [bundled into raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/tree/master/src/external)\n   40    - Multiple platforms supported: **Windows, Linux, MacOS, RPI, Android, HTML5... and more!**\n   41    - Written in plain C code (C99) using PascalCase/camelCase notation\n   42    - Hardware accelerated with OpenGL (**1.1, 2.1, 3.3, 4.3, ES 2.0 or ES 3.0**)\n   43:   - **Unique OpenGL abstraction layer** (usable as standalone module): [rlgl](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/src/rlgl.h)\n   44    - Multiple **Fonts** formats supported (TTF, Image fonts, AngelCode fonts)\n   45    - Multiple texture formats supported, including **compressed formats** (DXT, ETC, ASTC)\n   ..\n   48    - **Animated 3D models** supported (skeletal bones animation) (IQM)\n   49    - Shaders support, including model and **postprocessing** shaders.\n   50:   - **Powerful math module** for Vector, Matrix and Quaternion operations: [raymath](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/src/raymath.h)\n   51    - Audio loading and playing with streaming support (WAV, OGG, MP3, FLAC, XM, MOD)\n   52    - **VR stereo rendering** support with configurable HMD device parameters\n   ..\n  141  raylib is licensed under an unmodified zlib/libpng license, which is an OSI-certified, BSD-like license that allows static linking with
